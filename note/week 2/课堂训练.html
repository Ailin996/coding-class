	Hi All! Thanks for joining the class, and sorry we ran out of time and I wasn't able to walk through this in detail with everyone.  As promised, here is the link to the course page, I have already posted it on Slack.

	https://www.notion.so/unthink/Welcome-to-Coding-for-Learner-Experience-Designers-7cfd95566ad448fab95f1385f36debb1

	Once there you will see the Assignments link.  Clicking on Week 1 Assignments will take you here:  

	https://www.notion.so/unthink/Week-1-Assignments-80a30630da404cb084a32dfca1a8f855

	When you click on the Challenge link you will find a little video that I just created that walks you through the details of the challenge and quick tour on some of the reference material I created for you.

	If anything on the assignment or reference material is not clear send me a message on Slack. If it is not clear to you, chances are that it isn't clear to others.
